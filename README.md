# Woman Affair Prediction
This repository contains the code and dataset for predicting the likelihood of a woman having an affair. The prediction is based on various factors such as Women Occupation, Husband Occupation, Rate Marriage, Women Age, Number of Years Marride, Number of Children, religious, and Education. The project aims to provide insights into the factors that contribute to extramarital affairs among women.

# Dataset
The dataset I chose is the affairs dataset that comes with Statsmodels. It was derived from a survey of women in 1974 by Redbook magazine, in which married women were asked about their participation in extramarital affairs. More information about the study is available in a 1978 paper from the Journal of Political Economy.

**`Description of Dataset :`**

The dataset contains 6366 observations of 9 variables:

**`rate_marriage`** **:** woman's rating of her marriage (1 = very poor, 5 = very good)

**`age`** **:** woman's age

**`yrs_married`** **:** number of years married

**`children`** **:** number of children

**`religious`** **:**  woman's rating of how religious she is (1 = not religious, 4 =strongly religious)

**`educ`** **:**  level of education (9 = grade school, 12 = high school, 14 = some college, 16 = college graduate, 17 = some graduate school,20 = advanced degree)

**`occupation`** **:**  woman's occupation (1 = student, 2 = farming/semi-skilled/unskilled, 3 = "white collar", 4 = teacher/nurse/writer/technician/skilled, 5 = managerial/business, 6 = professional with advanced degree)

**`occupation_husb`** **:**  husband's occupation (same coding as above)

**`affairs`** **:** time spent in extra-marital affairs

# Code
The code for the affair prediction model is implemented in Python and is available in the [**`Women_Affair_Prediction.ipynb`**](https://github.com/iamaakashpal/Woman-Affair-Prediction/blob/main/Women_Affair_Prediction.ipynb) Jupyter Notebook. The notebook provides step-by-step instructions for data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.

The following dependencies are required to run the code in this repository:

```

# Results

The prediction model achieves an accuracy of approximately **`67%`** in classifying whether a woman is likely to have an affair. The evaluation metrics and additional insights can be found in the notebook.
